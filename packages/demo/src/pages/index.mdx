## Introduction

Equality UI is a shared React component library built with **Vite, Tailwind v4, Radix UI,** and **Framer Motion** — designed to unify styles, motion, and accessibility across all EQTY Lab applications.  
It provides a consistent visual system, fully scoped components, and a flexible theming layer that allows each host app to maintain brand individuality without reinventing base UI patterns.

## What's inside

- **Composable React components** powered by Radix primitives
- **Scoped styling** with Tailwind v4 + CSS Modules — no global leaks
- **Dynamic theming** through the `ThemeProvider` (light, dark, custom)
- **Framer Motion animations** for polished, consistent interactions
- **Built for reuse** across EQTY Lab products — from dashboards to marketing sites

## Design philosophy

Equality UI is built around three core principles:

1. **Isolation by default**  
   Every component manages its own scoped styles — nothing leaks, nothing collides.
2. **Token-driven theming**  
   Colors, spacing, and typography are defined as design tokens via CSS variables and Tailwind tokens.
3. **Motion as language**  
   Animation supports communication — subtle, meaningful, and consistent across products.

## Getting started

Install directly from GitHub Packages:

```bash
npm install @eqtylab/equality
```

Then head to the [Installation](/getting-started/installation) page to configure authentication and start using components.

## Documentation structure

- [Installation](/getting-started/installation) — setup and authentication
- [Usage](/getting-started/usage) — wrapping your app and using components
- [Themes](/getting-started/themes) — light/dark system
- [Customization](/getting-started/customizing) — overrides and brand tokens
- [Component Architecture](/getting-started/component-architecture) — how everything works internally

## For developers

Equality UI is framework-agnostic — it works seamlessly in **Vite**, **Next.js**, and **Astro** environments. Just wrap your app with the `<ThemeProvider>` and import the components you need — everything else is automatic.

## About and Purpose

Equality UI was created to **unify the design language** across EQTY Lab products like Governance Studio, Lineage Explorer, and VCOMP.  
It simplifies collaboration between design and engineering by turning shared patterns, brand tokens, and motion principles into reusable, theme-driven components.  
The goal is simple: **build once, use everywhere** — without sacrificing craft, performance, or individuality.
