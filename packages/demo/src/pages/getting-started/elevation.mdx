## What is Elevation

Elevation defines how components are layered and how much visual emphasis they carry.

Generally, nested elevations should only ever be one level away from one another.

## Types of Elevation

### Sunken

A low-emphasis elevation that recedes into the background. Ideal for secondary or decorative elements that should feel embedded rather than prominent.

<Icon
  icon="Shield"
  client:only="react"
  background="square"
  elevation={ELEVATION.SUNKEN}
/>

### Base

A neutral elevation that forms the baseline of the interface. Most components will use this level in standard layouts.

<DisplayFieldWithSlotDemo
  prefix="Key"
  client:only="react"
  elevation={ELEVATION.BASE}
/>

### Raised

A higher-priority elevation used to lift important content out of the page flow without breaking it.

<Card elevation={ELEVATION.RAISED}>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <h4 className="font-medium">Card</h4>
      <p className="text-text-secondary text-sm">
        This card has an elevation of Raised.
      </p>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>

### Overlay

Use for UI that overlays the page and requires clear separation from the underlying content.

<TooltipDemo client:only="react" />

### Floating

An elevated surface reserved for UI that must remain visually dominant, even over modals or dropdowns.

<DialogWithTableDemo client:only="react" />

## Elevation component prop

Some components have an `elevation` prop that can be used to set the elevation of the component. By default, they will be set to the one that makes most sense in a standard page flow.

The following components have an `elevation` prop:

- Card
- DisplayField
- Dropdown Menu (in `DropdownContent` component)
- Dialog
- Drawer
- Filter Dropdown (for dropdown with `dropdownElevation` prop)
- Icon
- Info Card
- Pagination (for dropdown with `dropdownElevation` prop)
- Popover
- Radio Dropdown (for dropdown with `dropdownElevation` prop)
- Select (in `SelectContent` component)
- Sort Selector (for dropdown with `dropdownElevation` prop)
- Table
- Tooltip
