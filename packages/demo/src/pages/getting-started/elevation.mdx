## What is Elevation

Elevation defines how components are layered and how much visual emphasis they carry.

Generally, nested elevations should only ever be one level away from one another.

## Types of Elevation

### Sunken

A low-emphasis elevation that recedes into the background. Ideal for secondary or decorative elements that should feel embedded rather than prominent.

<Icon
  icon="Shield"
  client:only="react"
  background="square"
  elevation={ELEVATION.SUNKEN}
/>

### Base

A neutral elevation that forms the baseline of the interface. Most components will use this level in standard layouts.

<DisplayFieldWithSlotDemo
  prefix="Key"
  client:only="react"
  elevation={ELEVATION.BASE}
/>

### Raised

A higher-priority elevation used to lift important content out of the page flow without breaking it.

<Card elevation={ELEVATION.RAISED}>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <h4 className="font-medium">Card</h4>
      <p className="text-text-secondary text-sm">
        This card has an elevation of Raised.
      </p>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>

### Overlay

Use for UI that overlays the page and requires clear separation from the underlying content.

<TooltipDemo client:only="react" />

### Floating

An elevated surface reserved for UI that must remain visually dominant, even over modals or dropdowns.

<DialogWithTableDemo client:only="react" />

## Elevation component prop

Some components have an `elevation` prop that can be used to set the elevation of the component. By default, they will be set to the one that makes most sense in a standard page flow.

To set a new elevation, use the `ELEVATION` constant:

```tsx
import { ELEVATION } from "@eqtylab/equality";

<Component elevation={ELEVATION.BASE} />;
```

The following components have an `elevation` prop:

| Component       | Default Elevation | Notes                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Card            | Raised            |                                            |
| DisplayField    | Base              |                                            |
| Dropdown Menu   | Overlay           | in `DropdownContent` component             |
| Filter Dropdown | Overlay           | for dropdown with `dropdownElevation` prop |
| Icon            | Sunken            |                                            |
| Info Card       | Raised            |                                            |

| Table           | Base              |                                            |
