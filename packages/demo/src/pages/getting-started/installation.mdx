## Using the library in your app

Install the package inside your app's workspace using your preferred package manager:

```bash
pnpm add @eqtylab/equality
# or
npm install @eqtylab/equality
# or
yarn add @eqtylab/equality
# or
bun add @eqtylab/equality
```

## Access

This is a **private GitHub package** published under the [EQTY Lab](https://github.com/eqtylab) organization. Make sure your npm or GitHub account has permission to access [this package](https://github.com/orgs/eqtylab/packages/npm/package/equality).

### 1. Authenticate with GitHub Packages

You will need a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with at least the `read:packages` scope.

Create one at: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

### 2. Add your GitHub token to npm

Add your token to npm config so it can authenticate to GitHub's registry.

#### Option A — via npm CLI (recommended):

```bash
npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

#### Option B — via `.npmrc` file:

Create or edit a `.npmrc` file in your project root and add:

```ini
@eqtylab:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### 3. Verify access

Run this to check if you can access the package:

```bash
npm view @eqtylab/equality
```

If that command returns package details, you're good to go.

### 4. Troubleshooting

If you run into a `404` or `ERR_PNPM_FETCH_404` error:

- Double-check your GitHub token includes the `read:packages` permission.
- Make sure your `.npmrc` file is in the same directory where you're installing.
- Confirm the registry line points to `https://npm.pkg.github.com`.
- If you're in a monorepo, also add the `.npmrc` file to the repo root.
- Try clearing the npm cache:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```
