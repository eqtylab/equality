## Setting up the theme

### Option 1: Use the `ThemeProvider` component

Add the `<ThemeProvider />` at the root of your app or wherever Equality components are used:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme="light">
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

This sets up all required CSS variables and makes sure the components render correctly.

### Option 2: Manual setup

Add the Equality stylesheet to the app:

```tsx
import "@eqtylab/equality/theme.css";
```

Add the theme data attribute to the root element or wherever Equality components are used:

```tsx
<html data-equality-theme="light">
  <YourApp />
</html>
```

If the data attribute is added somewhere other than on the root element, import the `<Portal />` component inside of the wrapper to ensure that portaled components still have the correct styling applied:

```tsx
import { Portal } from "@eqtylab/equality";

<div data-equality-theme="light">
  {...}
  <Portal />
</div>;
```

## Use components

Each component includes its own scoped `.module.css` file — no need to import a global stylesheet.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Primary</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Because the styles use Tailwind v4 tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.), everything is resolved automatically based on the active theme.

## Overriding styles with `className`

All components accept a `className` prop for fine-grained style adjustments. This lets you extend or override the default styles directly from your app without breaking isolation:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-accent hover:bg-accent/80 text-white">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

Since each component's styles are scoped with CSS Modules, your overrides stay local and won't leak into other components.
