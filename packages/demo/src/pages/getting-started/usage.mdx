## Setting up the theme

Import the Equality stylesheet. In order to use the theme colors within your project code, the import must be added to the stylesheet rather than within the App code:

```tsx
@import "@eqtylab/equality/theme.css";
```

Optional: Add the theme data attribute to the root element. This sets the default theme. If no data attribute is found, the default from the user's browser settings will be used:

```tsx
<html data-equality-theme="light">
  <YourApp />
</html>
```

Optional: Initialize with the user's stored theme preference. This is not needed if you are not needing to store the user's theme preference:

```tsx
TODO;
```

## Use components

Each component includes its own scoped `.module.css` file — no need to import a global stylesheet.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Primary</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Because the styles use Tailwind v4 tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.), everything is resolved automatically based on the active theme.

## Overriding styles with `className`

All components accept a `className` prop for fine-grained style adjustments. This lets you extend or override the default styles directly from your app without breaking isolation:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-accent hover:bg-accent/80 text-white">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

Since each component's styles are scoped with CSS Modules, your overrides stay local and won't leak into other components.
