## Setting up the theme

### Tailwind v4

Import the Equality Tailwind v4 configuration into your global stylesheet (this includes preflight (base styles), theme colors, variables, utilities and components):

```tsx
@import "@eqtylab/equality/theme-config.css";
```

### Other CSS frameworks

Add the `<ThemeProvider />` at the root of your app or wherever Equality components are used:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider>
  <YourApp />
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Use components

Each component includes its own scoped `.module.css` file — no need to import a global stylesheet.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Primary</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Because the styles use Tailwind v4 tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.), everything is resolved automatically based on the active theme.

## Overriding styles with `className`

All components accept a `className` prop for fine-grained style adjustments. This lets you extend or override the default styles directly from your app without breaking isolation:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-accent hover:bg-accent/80 text-white">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

Since each component's styles are scoped with CSS Modules, your overrides stay local and won't leak into other components.
