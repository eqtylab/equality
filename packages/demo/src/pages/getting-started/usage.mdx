## Setting up the theme

Import the Equality stylesheet. In order to use the theme colors within your project code, the import must be added to the stylesheet rather than within the App code:

```tsx
@import "@eqtylab/equality/theme.css";
```

Add the theme data attribute to the root element. This sets the default theme. If no value is given, the default from the user's browser settings will be used:

```tsx
<html data-equality-theme>
  <YourApp />
</html>
```

Optional: A lightweight script to initialize the theme with a dynamic value - either with the user's stored theme preferences (`{store: true}`) or their browser settings (default: `{store: false}`). This needs to be imported inline in the `<head>` in order for it to be picked up before rendering. This is not needed if you are not wanting the theme to be dynamic:

```tsx
import { initializeTheme } from "@eqtylab/equality";

<head>
  <script>{initializeTheme({ store: true })}</script>
</head>;
```

## Use components

Each component includes its own scoped `.module.css` file — no need to import a global stylesheet.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Primary</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Because the styles use Tailwind v4 tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.), everything is resolved automatically based on the active theme.

## Overriding styles with `className`

All components accept a `className` prop for fine-grained style adjustments. This lets you extend or override the default styles directly from your app without breaking isolation:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-accent hover:bg-accent/80 text-white">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

Since each component's styles are scoped with CSS Modules, your overrides stay local and won't leak into other components.
