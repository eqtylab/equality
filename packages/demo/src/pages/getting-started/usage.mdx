## Setting up the theme

### Tailwind v4

Import the Equality Tailwind v4 color configuration into your global stylesheet:

```tsx
@import "@eqtylab/equality/theme-config.css";
```

### Other CSS frameworks

Add the `<ThemeProvider />` at the root of your app or wherever Equality components are used:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider>
  <YourApp />
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Optional: Initializating the theme

A lightweight script to initialize the theme with a dynamic value. Use the option `shouldStoreTheme: true` to initialize with `localStorage` to store the user's theme preference, or `shouldStoreTheme: false` (default) to initialize with the browser's theme settings. This needs to be imported inline in the `<head>` in order for it to be picked up before rendering. This is not needed if you are not wanting the theme to be initialized with a dynamic value:

```tsx
import { initializeTheme } from "@eqtylab/equality/scripts";

<head>
  <script>{initializeTheme({ shouldStoreTheme: true })}</script>
</head>;
```

Tip: For Vite, you can inject the initializer script into the head by adding the following to `vite.app.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { initializeTheme } from "@eqtylab/equality/scripts";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    {
      name: "inject-equality-theme-initializer",
      transformIndexHtml() {
        const inlineThemeScript = initializeTheme({ shouldStoreTheme: true });
        return [
          {
            tag: "script",
            attrs: { id: "equality-theme-init" },
            children: inlineThemeScript,
            injectTo: "head-prepend",
          },
        ];
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Use components

Each component includes its own scoped `.module.css` file — no need to import a global stylesheet.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Primary</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Because the styles use Tailwind v4 tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.), everything is resolved automatically based on the active theme.

## Overriding styles with `className`

All components accept a `className` prop for fine-grained style adjustments. This lets you extend or override the default styles directly from your app without breaking isolation:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-accent hover:bg-accent/80 text-white">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

Since each component's styles are scoped with CSS Modules, your overrides stay local and won't leak into other components.
