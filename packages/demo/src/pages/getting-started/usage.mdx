## Setting up the theme

Add the `<ThemeProvider />` at the root of your app or wherever Equality components are used:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme="light">
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

This sets up all required CSS variables and makes sure the components render correctly.

## Use components

Each component includes its own scoped `.module.css` file — no need to import a global stylesheet.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Primary</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Because the styles use Tailwind v4 tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.), everything is resolved automatically based on the active theme.

## Overriding styles with `className`

All components accept a `className` prop for fine-grained style adjustments. This lets you extend or override the default styles directly from your app without breaking isolation:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-accent hover:bg-accent/80 text-white">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

Since each component's styles are scoped with CSS Modules, your overrides stay local and won't leak into other components.
