## Setting up the theme

By default, only the components wrapped in `<ThemeProvider />` will use the theme colors.

Wrap components that use the Equality theme colors in `<ThemeProvider />`. You will probably want to add this near the root of your project:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider>
  <YourApp />
</ThemeProvider>
```

Optional: Import the Equality Tailwind v4 color configuration. If you are using Tailwind v4 and want to use the theme colors at the top level of your project code (like in your global stylesheet), the import must be added to your global stylesheet:

```tsx
@import "@eqtylab/equality/theme-colors.css";
```

Optional: A lightweight script to initialize the theme with a dynamic value. Use the option `shouldStoreTheme: true` to initialize with `localStorage` to store the user's theme preference, or `shouldStoreTheme: false` (default) to initialize with the browser's theme settings. This needs to be imported inline in the `<head>` in order for it to be picked up before rendering. This is not needed if you are not wanting the theme to be initialized with a dynamic value:

```tsx
import { initializeTheme } from "@eqtylab/equality/scripts";

<head>
  <script>{initializeTheme({ shouldStoreTheme: true })}</script>
</head>;
```

Tip: For Vite, you can inject the initializer script into the head by adding the following to `vite.app.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { initializeTheme } from "@eqtylab/equality/scripts";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    {
      name: "inject-equality-theme-initializer",
      transformIndexHtml() {
        const inlineThemeScript = initializeTheme({ shouldStoreTheme: true });
        return [
          {
            tag: "script",
            attrs: { id: "equality-theme-init" },
            children: inlineThemeScript,
            injectTo: "head-prepend",
          },
        ];
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Use components

Each component includes its own scoped `.module.css` file — no need to import a global stylesheet.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@eqtylab/equality";

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>Primary</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Because the styles use Tailwind v4 tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc.), everything is resolved automatically based on the active theme.

## Overriding styles with `className`

All components accept a `className` prop for fine-grained style adjustments. This lets you extend or override the default styles directly from your app without breaking isolation:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-accent hover:bg-accent/80 text-white">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

Since each component's styles are scoped with CSS Modules, your overrides stay local and won't leak into other components.
