## Font Files

There is one font used throughout the Equality theme. This is either TWK Lausanne or Inter. You only need to install one or the other.

### Primary: TWK Lausanne

The official font of EQTY Lab is TWK Lausanne.

For use on Equality projects, we have a private npm package for this font:

```bash
npm install @eqtylab/equality-fonts
#or
pnpm add @eqtylab/equality-fonts
# or
yarn add @eqtylab/equality-fonts
# or
bun add @eqtylab/equality-fonts
```

For use on other projects, you can [purchase this font](https://weltkern.com/typefaces/lausanne) and install it yourself.

### Fallback: Inter

The fallback font is Inter. This is a free font and can be installed or downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).

## Usage

Import the font files into your project either using `@font-face` or your framework's recommended method.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "TWK Lausanne";
  src: (...);
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

The minimum required font-weights are `400` and `600`.

The minimum required font-style is `normal`.

If the imported font-family name is `TWK Lausanne` or `Inter`, you are done.

If the imported font-family name is different or inside a CSS variable, you will need to update the CSS primary font variable accordingly:

```css
@theme inline {
  --font-primary: var(--twk-lausanne); /* Replace with your font-family name */
}
```
