## Built-in themes

Equality ships with two built-in themes:

- `light`
- `dark`

You can set the default theme in the `data-equality-theme` attribute on the root element:

```tsx
<html data-equality-theme="dark">
  <App />
</html>
```

## Getting and settings the theme

You can use the `useTheme()` hook:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@eqtylab/equality";

const [theme, setTheme] = useTheme();
```

## Default variables

### Tailwind v4

The theme color palettes are added to your Tailwind config when you import the `@eqtylab/equality/theme-colors.css` file.

You can inspect the applied tokens directly in DevTools by selecting the `html` element.

### Other CSS frameworks

Each theme includes its own palette of colors. You don't need to import or configure these — they're injected automatically by the provider.

```css
--color-primary: hsl(210 40% 98%);
--color-muted: hsl(240 4% 16%);
```

You can inspect the applied tokens directly in DevTools by selecting the root element wrapped by `ThemeProvider`.
