## Built-in themes

Equality ships with two built-in themes:

- `light`
- `dark`

You can set them through the `theme` prop on the `ThemeProvider`:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider theme="dark">
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

Switching themes automatically updates all Tailwind semantic tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-muted`, etc.) at runtime — no reloads or extra configuration.

## Default variables

Each theme includes its own palette of colors. You don't need to import or configure these — they're injected automatically by the provider.

```css
--color-primary: hsl(210 40% 98%);
--color-muted: hsl(240 4% 16%);
```

You can inspect the applied tokens directly in DevTools by selecting the root element wrapped by `ThemeProvider`.
