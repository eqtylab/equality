## Color Variants

---

The Badge component comes with four color variants to visually communicate different statuses or contexts:

- **Primary:** The default style, suitable for general labeling.
- **Neutral:** For non-critical, informational, or secondary status.
- **Danger:** Indicates an error or warning state requiring attention.
- **Success:** Represents positive outcomes or completed statuses.

Select the appropriate variant by using the `variant` prop, for example:

```tsx
<Badge variant="danger">Danger Badge</Badge>
```

### Primary (default)

<Badge>This is a badge</Badge>

### Neutral

<Badge variant="neutral">This is a badge</Badge>

### Warning

<Badge variant="warning">This is a badge</Badge>

### Danger

<Badge variant="danger">This is a badge</Badge>

### Success

<Badge variant="success">This is a badge</Badge>

## Closable Variant

---

The closable variant of the Badge is commonly used to represent active filters or selections, such as when content is filtered by a search bar. This allows users to easily remove specific filters by clicking the close button on the corresponding badge.

## Truncation

---

The Badge component supports text truncation for long content. Use the `truncate` prop to enable truncation, and optionally set a custom `truncateLength` (defaults to 50 characters). When text exceeds the specified length, it will be truncated with an ellipsis ("..."), and the full text will be displayed in a tooltip on hover. This is particularly useful for maintaining consistent badge sizes when displaying variable-length content.

## Icon

---

You can enhance your badge by displaying an icon. The `icon` prop accepts either a string corresponding to any [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/icons/) icon key (such as `"Layers"` or `"CheckCircle"`), or you can provide a custom icon component. For custom icons, pass a React component or element to the `icon` prop.

<Badge icon="Layers">This is a badge</Badge>

### Usage

```tsx
// Using a Lucide React icon by name
<Badge icon="Layers">With Lucide Icon</Badge>

// Using a custom icon component
<Badge icon={<MyCustomIcon />}>With Custom Icon</Badge>
```
