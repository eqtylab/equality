import { DateRangePickerDemo } from "@demo/components/demo/date-range-picker";

## Default

<DateRangePickerDemo client:only="react" />

## Minimum width

To normalize the appearance of the Date Range Picker across different layouts, a minimum width of `16rem` is applied. This helps ensure consistency and alignment regardless of the surrounding container size.

<DateRangePickerDemo client:only="react" displayMinWidth />
