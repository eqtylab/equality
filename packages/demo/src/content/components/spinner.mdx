## Color Variants

This component supports several color variants that reflect the brand and UI context. You can use variants such as `primary`, `secondary`, `green`, `red`, and `gold` to visually distinguish loading spinners in line with your application's design language. Each color maps directly to a brand color defined in the Equality design system, ensuring visual consistency throughout your interface.

The special `theme` variant adapts the spinner to use the primary text color, automatically switching between light and dark themes according to your app’s current appearance mode.
