import { BgGradientDemo } from "@demo/components/demo/bg-gradient";

## Overview

The component supports all brand colors (primary, secondary, tertiary, red, yellow) and will automatically pick up new colors added to the `equality-tokens.json` file. The hex values are read directly from the JSON, keeping the component in sync with design tokens.

## Theme Variants

### Theme Primary

<BgGradientDemo client:load />

### Theme Secondary

<BgGradientDemo client:load variant="secondary" />

### Theme Tertiary

<BgGradientDemo client:load variant="tertiary" />

### Theme Red

<BgGradientDemo client:load variant="red" />

### Theme Yellow

<BgGradientDemo client:load variant="yellow" />

## Placement Variants

You can control where the background gradient appears by selecting its placement. Use the `placement` prop to choose between `"full"` (covering the entire container) or `"top"` (applying the gradient only to the top portion). This allows flexible use for backgrounds that need either total coverage or more subtle decoration across the top.

### Placement Full

<BgGradientDemo client:load placement="full" />

### Placement Top

<BgGradientDemo client:load placement="top" />
