## Size Variants

The `CopyButton` component supports three size variants: small (`"sm"`), medium (`"md"`), and large (`"lg"`). By adjusting the `size` prop, you can easily change the button's dimensions to fit a variety of interfaces and design needs. The default size is `"sm"`, making it compact, while `"md"` and `"lg"` provide progressively larger clickable areas.

### Small (default)

<CopyButton
  value="zQ3shrGxRrYyWixJGrr45jJ1MEY76YQZ4KVbt9CYRsTWZ5MWV"
  client:only="react"
/>

### Medium

<CopyButton
  value="zQ3shrGxRrYyWixJGrr45jJ1MEY76YQZ4KVbt9CYRsTWZ5MWV"
  size="md"
  client:only="react"
/>

### Large

<CopyButton
  value="zQ3shrGxRrYyWixJGrr45jJ1MEY76YQZ4KVbt9CYRsTWZ5MWV"
  size="lg"
  client:only="react"
/>

## Props

### `onClick` handler

The `CopyButton` component exposes an `onClick` prop, which allows you to provide a custom function that will be called whenever the button is clicked. This makes the component highly composable, enabling you to trigger additional logic—such as showing a toast notification, logging analytics, or updating application state—alongside the built-in copy-to-clipboard behavior.

For example, you can use the `onClick` handler to display a custom message:

```jsx
<CopyButton
  value="sample text"
  onClick={() => alert("Button clicked! Text copied!")}
  client:only="react"
/>
```

The `onClick` function is called after text has been copied to the clipboard.

<CopyButtonDemo client:only="react" size="md" />
