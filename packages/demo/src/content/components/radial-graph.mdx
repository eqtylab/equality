## Color Variants

This component supports several color variants that correspond with the brand colors. You can use these variants — such as `primary`, `secondary`, `green`, `red`, and `gold` — to visually distinguish different types of radial graphs or their context according to your design needs. Each color maps directly to a brand color in the Equality design system, allowing for consistent and meaningful styling in your application.

<RadialGraph percentage={60} />

### Secondary

<RadialGraph percentage={40} color="secondary" />

### Green

<RadialGraph percentage={95} color="green" />

### Red

<RadialGraph percentage={10} color="red" />

### Gold

<RadialGraph percentage={100} color="gold" />
